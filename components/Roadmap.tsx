                  I need to thank Koji Mochizuki (<a href="https://twitter.com/kjmczk" target="_blank">@kjmczk</a>)
                  for both his medium article and this website template being provided. It is a super helpful entry point and has taught me loads.
                  I mainly referred to his <a href="https://medium.com/technest/how-to-launch-an-nft-project-by-yourself-252a7fefa748" target="blank">Medium Article</a>
                  which is an end to end guide on how to launch an NFT project

                  I also need to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/hashlipsnft" target="_blank">@hashlipsnft</a>. We've used their smart contract as a base
                  and is another valuable resource into learning about Web3 from a technical point of view.
